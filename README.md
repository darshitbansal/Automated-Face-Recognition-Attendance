# Automated Real-Time Face Recognition and Attendance Tracking System

ðŸš€ An AI-powered **real-time face recognition and attendance tracking system** that uses computer vision to automatically identify individuals, track their presence, and log attendance efficiently.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- **Face Recognition & Tracking**: Uses deep learning-based face encodings to recognize individuals in real time.
- **Automated Attendance**: Marks attendance in an Excel file (`data/attendance.xlsx`).
- **Session Management**: Tracks presence within a defined time window (e.g., 1 hour).
- **Robust Accuracy**: Uses threshold-based reappearance handling to reduce false positives.
- **Time Spent Tracking**: Records the total duration each person was in front of the camera.
